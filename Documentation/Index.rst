TYPO3 site package tutorial
===========================

A site package is a custom :ref:`TYPO3 extension <t3start:concepts-extensions>`
that contains files regarding the theme and functionality of a site.

This tutorial describes step by step how to come from your first TYPO3
installation to the first basic site.

You can download the example site package used in this tutorial from GitHub:
https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/site_package

..  note::
    The example site package is structured for educational purposes and is
    not intended for use in production environments.

    ..  card:: :ref:`Introduction <t3sitepackage:introduction>`

        Here we define the benefits of the site package: like the concepts of
        encapsulation, the concepts of dependency management, the clean
        separation from the userspace (fileadmin/FAL), some important security
        benefits, deployment and distributability advantages.

    ..  card:: :ref:`Prerequisites <t3sitepackage:prerequisites>`

        In this section we mention the prerequisites that you need before
        you start with this tutorial.

        ..  card-footer:: :ref:`See the prerequisites <t3sitepackage:prerequisites>`

    ..  card:: :ref:`Create initial pages <t3sitepackage:typo3-backend-create-initial-pages>`

        Here we use :composer:`t3docs/site-package-data` to create a basic site
        configuration and some pages in the TYPO3 backend with some example
        content records.

        ..  card-footer:: :ref:`Create some dummy content <t3sitepackage:typo3-backend-create-initial-pages>`
            :button-style: btn btn-secondary stretched-link

    ..  card:: :ref:`Minimal site package <t3sitepackage:minimal-design>`

        Create a minimal site package that outputs "Hello World".

        ..  card-footer:: :ref:`Create a minimal site package <t3sitepackage:minimal-design>`
            :button-style: btn btn-secondary stretched-link

    ..  card:: :ref:`Extension Installation <t3sitepackage:extension-installation>`

        In this section we go through the process of installing the site
        package extension with composer.

        ..  card-footer:: :ref:`Add your site package with composer <t3sitepackage:extension-installation>`

    ..  card:: :ref:`Assets <assets-theme>`

        Assets usually include CSS files, JavaScript and images / icons used
        for design purposes.

        ..  card-footer:: :ref:`Copy the assets into your site package <assets-theme>`
            :button-style: btn btn-secondary stretched-link

    ..  card:: :ref:`Fluid Template <t3sitepackage:fluid-templates>`

        We introduce the templating engine Fluid, that is used to render the
        html pieces in a logically manner. Then we describe the directory
        structure that is needed in a site package extension. We also
        explain the first steps to include the previously static files and
        html pieces using Fluid.

        ..  card-footer:: :ref:`Learn about Fluid and Templating <t3sitepackage:fluid-templates>`
            :button-style: btn btn-secondary stretched-link

    ..  card:: :ref:`Content mapping <t3sitepackage:content-mapping>`

        Here we explain the purpose of backend layouts. Additionally we
        introduce the DatabaseQueryProcessor which is used to render content
        from a special "colPos" previously defined in the backend layout.
        We use Fluid to output content from a specific colPos. By this we
        get to know the cObject ViewHelper.

        ..  card-footer:: :ref:`See how to use a backend layout <t3sitepackage:content-mapping>`

    ..  card:: :ref:`TypoScript setup <t3sitepackage:typoscript-configuration>`

        Theoretically you could put all TypoScript into one big file and it would work
        fine. But you have better overview if you split it up in multiple files ordered
        by purpose. We import all TypoScript files from a folder using wildcards
        after this step.

        ..  card-footer:: :ref:`Automatically import TypoScript files <t3sitepackage:typoscript-configuration>`
            :button-style: btn btn-secondary stretched-link

    ..  card:: :ref:`Main menu <t3sitepackage:main-menu-creation>`

        We introduce the main menu, explain how we build up a menu
        processor with TypoScript and how we can output the menu with Fluid.
        We introduce the so called "Debug ViewHelper".

        ..  card-footer:: :ref:`Learn to create & output a menu <t3sitepackage:main-menu-creation>`
            :button-style: btn btn-secondary stretched-link

    ..  card:: :ref:`Site sets <t3sitepackage:site-sets-configuration>`

        In this section we configure the site package using the new
        concept of site sets. The settings are now stored in a yaml file
        called :file:`settings.definitions.yaml`.

        ..  card-footer:: :ref:`Learn about the configuration of a site package <t3sitepackage:site-sets-configuration>`
            :button-style: btn btn-secondary stretched-link


    ..  card:: :ref:`Extension Configuration <t3sitepackage:extension-configuration>`

        We explain the needed composer configurations and we connect it with
        the site sets configurations that we made in the previous chapter.

        ..  card-footer:: :ref:`Discover the composer configurations <t3sitepackage:extension-configuration>`
            :button-style: btn btn-secondary stretched-link

    ..  card:: :ref:`Summary <t3sitepackage:summary>`

        In this chapter we sum up the steps that we did after we have gone
        through this tutorial.
