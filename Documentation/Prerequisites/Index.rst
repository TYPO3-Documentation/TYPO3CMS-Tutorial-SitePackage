Prerequisites to create a TYPO3 site package extension
======================================================

Before you start working on this tutorial you should have a working TYPO3
installation in versions 13.4 or above.

We assume you use Composer and work locally with DDEV.

Your TYPO3 installation should be empty and have no pages, designs or third
party extensions installed.

You can follow this tutorial to install TYPO3 with DDEV and Composer:

*   :ref:`Installing TYPO3 with DDEV <t3start:installation-ddev-tutorial>`.

..  note:: Answer "no" when asked if you want to create a basic site.

You should be able to log in into the TYPO3 backend and see the following:
