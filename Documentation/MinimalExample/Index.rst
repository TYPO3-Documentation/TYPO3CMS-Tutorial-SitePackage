===============
Minimal example
===============

We want to create a site package that outputs a single web page with
minimal effort. This site package can be used to simply test system output or as
an example of the fewest possible steps to create a working site package.

To start, in the TYPO3 backend, create a standard page named
:guilabel:`Minimal example` just under (inside) the page tree TYPO3 logo
container. Create a new TypoScript template record on this page.
Give the TypoScript template a title, and make it a root level template,
but do not include any static templates.

The TypoScript-only version
===========================

In the TypoScript template Setup field, add the following three lines:

.. code-block:: typoscript
   :caption: TypoScript Setup

   page = PAGE
   page.1 = TEXT
   page.1.value = Hello, world.

View the web page.

This TypoScript-only design has the least instructions required to output a
web page from TYPO3. This TypoScript template is self contained and
no other files or database records needed. Changing this content
only requires the appropriate access needed to make changes to TypoScript
templates.

The TYPO3 Fluid version
=======================

Empty the :guilabel:`Minimal design` page TypoScript template Setup field,
then add the following lines:

.. code-block:: typoscript
   :caption: TypoScript Setup

   page = PAGE
   page.1 = FLUIDTEMPLATE
   page.1.file = EXT:site_package/Resources/Private/Templates/Minimal.html

Create a file named :file:`Minimal.html` in a
:file:`typo3conf/ext/site_package/Resources/Private/Templates` folder.

The site package extension has to be :ref:`installed <extension-installation>`
and requires a :ref:`minimal composer configuration <extension-configuration>` (if composer is used)
for this to work

.. code-block:: html
   :caption: EXT:site_package/Resources/Private/Templates/Minimal.html

   Hello, world.

Now view the web page.

Here we are putting the page content into a separate HTML file, allowing for
separate access control and for an editing workflow that does not need much
TypoScript. The TYPO3 renderer still requires a TypoScript template on the
:guilabel:`Minimal design` page to know which file to process.

Resulting web page
==================

Here is the resulting web page HTML source for both the TypoScript-only and
the Fluid based implementations. Notice how TYPO3 has added default markup
around the single line of content:

.. code-block:: html
   :caption: Example frontend output

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
      <head>
         <meta charset="utf-8">
