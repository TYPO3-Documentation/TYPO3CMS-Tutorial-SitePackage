Enhance the site package
========================

The site package extension, as it stands now, still has some shortfalls. Let us
have a closer look what you could or should do as the next steps to address
these.

..  rst-class:: bignums

#.  Navigation menu features one level only

    The bigger the website becomes, the more likely is a multi-level page
    structure required. This means, editors will likely create sub-pages of the
    root page "Page 1" for example. At the moment, the menu does not support
    sub-pages.

    If this becomes a requirement, the TypoScript code used to generate the menu
    (see chapter :ref:`main-menu-creation`) and the Fluid template file that
    outputs the menu (:file:`Resources/Private/Layouts/Page/Default.html`) need
    to be updated.

#.  Jumbotron has no background image

    The Jumbotron stands as a place holder for various options in our example.
    Some readers may like to implement a banner with rotating images, some prefer a
    text content element or a video player instead. All this and much more is
    possible with TYPO3, but beyond the scope of this tutorial.

#.  There are no icons for pages in the menu

    It would be possible to define an additional field in the :sql:`pages`
    table to store an icon for each page and then output them in the menu for
    example.

#.  There is not footer

    The page could receive a footer with content taken from a special page or
    column of the root page.

In general, the nature of a tutorial, such as this document, is to provide
detailed instructions to walk a beginner through a particular task. By building
your own site package extension from scratch, you have learned each step that
is required to turn a basic web design template into a fully working website in
TYPO3.

When you create site packages in the future, you probably do not want to create
every file over and over again, but use a pre-built version of the site package
extension. Therefore, it make sense to store and maintain the current state in
a central place, such as a Git repository. Despite the fact that for a learning
experience it is always beneficial to develop the extension yourself, you can
also download the extension built in this tutorial below.
