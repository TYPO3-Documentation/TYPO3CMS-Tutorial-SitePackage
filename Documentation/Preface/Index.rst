Inspired by some initial discussions between Christian Kuhn, Benni Mack, Xavier
Perseguers, Michael Schams and Mathias Schreiber in mid 2016, this tutorial was
written by Michael Schams between 2017 and 2018. It is loosely based on the
concepts by Benjamin Kott, which he presented in a video with Mathias Schreiber
in November 2017 (see :ref:`youtube-videos`). The final version of this document
was published by the TYPO3 Documentation Team in April 2018.
