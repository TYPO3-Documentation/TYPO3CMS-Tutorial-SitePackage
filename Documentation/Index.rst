**Tutorial**

This document is a Tutorial. Tutorials are designed to be step-by-step
instructions specifically created to walk a beginner through a particular task
from beginning to end. To facilitate effective learning, Tutorials provide
examples to illustrate the subjects they cover. In addition, Tutorials provide
guidance on how to avoid common pitfalls and highlight key concepts that should
be remembered for future reference.


**Summary**

This tutorial describes the steps required to turn a basic design template
(HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, etc.) into a fully working, mobile-responsive
website powered by TYPO3. By creating a sitepackage extension, all relevant
files are stored at a central point and
changes can easily be tracked in version control.

Despite the fact that TYPO3 supports several methods of implementing websites,
this approach is a very flexible and professional way. At the same time, the
process is not overly complicated and does not require any programming
knowledge.
