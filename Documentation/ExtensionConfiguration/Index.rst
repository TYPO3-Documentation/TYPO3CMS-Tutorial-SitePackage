Extension Declaration File
==========================

Every TYPO3 extension requires a configuration file (also known as the
*extension declaration file*) to tell the TYPO3 instance some basic details of
the extension, possible dependencies, etc. Without this file, TYPO3 would not
know that the extension exists and as a consequence could not load it, nor
display it in the *Extension Manager*.

This file is named :file:`ext_emconf.php` and is expected in the root level of the
extension. The content should look as follows::

   <?php
   $EM_CONF[$_EXTKEY] = [
      'title' => 'TYPO3 Sitepackage',
      'description' => 'TYPO3 Sitepackage',
      'category' => 'templates',
      'author' => '...',
      'author_email' => '...',
      'author_company' => '...',
      'version' => '1.0.0',
      'state' => 'stable',
      'constraints' => [
         'depends' => [
            'typo3' => '8.7.0-9.5.99',
            'fluid_styled_content' => '8.7.0-9.5.99'
         ],
         'conflicts' => [
         ],
      ],
      'uploadfolder' => 0,
      'createDirs' => '',
      'clearCacheOnLoad' => 1
   ];

The values can and should be customized of course. A more meaningful and longer
description is recommended and defining some details about the author
(`author`, :code:`author_email` and :code:`author_company`) make also perfect sense. A
detailed description of all configuration options can be found in the
:ref:`Core API Reference <t3coreapi:extension-declaration>`.

Create and customize this file and store it as :file:`site_package/ext_emconf.php`.
The configration shown above will do the job, if you do not want to customize
the declaration file at the moment.


.. _extension-icon:

Extension Icon
==============

Not as important as the extension declaration file above, but every extension can
feature an icon using a PNG file. This image should be located in the root
directory of the extension as well, and must be named :file:`ext_icon.png`.
Choose or create an image of 64px width by 64px height.

.. note::

   Newer versions of TYPO3 support alternative formats and file locations.
   However, for the sake of simplicity we will stick to the specification outlined
   above.


.. _make-typoscript-available:

Make TypoScript Available
=========================

In order to automatically load the TypoScript files we have created in the
previous step, a new PHP file :file:`sys_template.php` needs to be created and
stored in directory :file:`Configuration/TCA/Overrides/`. The content of this file
should look like the following code::

   <?php
   defined('TYPO3_MODE') || die();

   call_user_func(function()
   {
      /**
       * Extension key
       */
      $extensionKey = 'site_package';

      /**
       * Default TypoScript
       */
      \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addStaticFile(
         $extensionKey,
         'Configuration/TypoScript',
         'Sitepackage'
      );
   });


.. _ec-directory-structure:

Directory and File Structure
============================

Let's review the directory and file structure of the sitepackage extension as
it stands now.

.. code-block:: none

    site_package/
    site_package/Configuration
    site_package/Configuration/TCA
    site_package/Configuration/TCA/Overrides
    site_package/Configuration/TCA/Overrides/sys_template.php
    site_package/Configuration/TypoScript
    site_package/Configuration/TypoScript/constants.typoscript
    site_package/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript
    site_package/ext_emconf.php
    site_package/ext_icon.png
    site_package/Resources
    site_package/Resources/Private
    site_package/Resources/Private/Layouts
    site_package/Resources/Private/Layouts/Page
    site_package/Resources/Private/Layouts/Page/Default.html
    site_package/Resources/Private/Partials
    site_package/Resources/Private/Partials/Page
    site_package/Resources/Private/Partials/Page/Jumbotron.html
    site_package/Resources/Private/Templates
    site_package/Resources/Private/Templates/Page
    site_package/Resources/Private/Templates/Page/Default.html
    site_package/Resources/Public
    site_package/Resources/Public/Css
    site_package/Resources/Public/Css/website.css
    site_package/Resources/Public/Images/
    site_package/Resources/Public/Images/logo.png
    site_package/Resources/Public/JavaScript
    site_package/Resources/Public/JavaScript/website.js

At this point we can install the sitepackage extension in a TYPO3 instance,
which we will do in the next step.
